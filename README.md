# algo-playground 
This is my personal algorithm playground where I implement and test various coding challenges using Python.
## Whatâ€™s Inside?
- String manipulation functions (e.g., reverse, find non-repeating, etc.)
- Integer and array utilities (e.g., binary gap, missing integers)
- Simple console runner to test selected functions interactively
- Clean, modular Python code following OOP principles
- 
##Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Git & GitHub

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
python runFunction.py

This repository helps me:
Practice for coding interviews (e.g., Codility, HackerRank)
Improve algorithm thinking and Python fluency
Build up my GitHub portfolio
